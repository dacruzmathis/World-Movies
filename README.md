# World Movies

Project for developing a website for movies and TV series that interacts with the OMDB and TMDB APIs.  
The site features a search interface for movies or series based on defined criteria.  
On the server side, there is storage (in files) of the films viewed by users, along with the generation of statistical data on the most viewed films.  
Licence 2 project made for the Web Development cursus at CY Paris Universit√©.  
Made with Lelievre Saidou.
